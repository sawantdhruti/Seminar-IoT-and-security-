\label{sec:discussion}
There are ccertain open research problems in the IoT-ICN application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do applications get permission to publish and operate under a given name?
\item How are namespace collisions handled?
\item Can we break our dependence on a centralized or decentralized PKI?
\item How can we adopt distributed trust models?
\item How can we enable object encryption without sacrificing privacy ?
\item Can we build better broadcast encryption schemes that can handle the foreseen IoT scale?
\item How do we create secure routing hints?
\item Can we decouple “application names” from “network names”?
\end{enumerate}
