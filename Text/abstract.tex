 Internet of Things (IoT) is connecting our physical world with the Internet e.g. connected automobiles, e-Health, smart homes , industrial automation et cetera. Information-centric Networking (ICN) is a concept that changes the Internet design which focuses on transmitting and accessing named content instead of the traditional host-based IP data. Several challenges present itself when we consider the dynamic infrastructure and deployment of IoT environment such as auto-configuration of the names,enabling push traffic and minimizing header size. However, the most significant challenge is to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive data transferred over the network. This report discusses the ICN-IoT middle-ware which provides a design level solution to the challenge of security and privacy in communication of data.
