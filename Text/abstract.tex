 Internet of Things (IoT) is connecting our physical world with the internet e.g. connected automibiles, e-Health, smart homes , industrial automation et cetera. Information-centric Networking (ICN) is a concept that changes the internet design which focuses on transmitting and accessing named content instead of the traditional host-based IP data. Several challenges present itself when we consider the dynamic infrastucture and deployment of IoT environment such as autoconfiguration of the names,enabling push traffic and minimising header size. However, the most significant chanllenge is to ensure the security and privacy of sensitive data transferred over the network.This report discusses the ICN-Iot middleware which provides a design level solution to the challenge of security and privacy in communication of data.
