\section{Introduction}

The Internet of things (IoT) is increasingly becoming part of our
everyday life. Examples of IoT application markets are car-to-car
communication, smart electricity grids and e-health systems. In
order to protect the processed data and the privacy of the users, it is important to implement dedicated security measures in IoT devices
and networks. 
Data in information-centric networking is delocalized and
need not be retrieved via an end-to-end transport stream.
Instead, hop-wise replication and in-network caching facilitate
information dissemination in the IoT, and relax the
demand for continued connectivity.
